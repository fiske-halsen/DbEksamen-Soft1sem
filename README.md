### Setup

**Step 1: Run the script for starting the application**

The file is located in the root called *StartApplication.sh* as shown below in the directory tree:

```
.
├── Application
├── Docker
├── React
├── README.md
├── StartApplication.sh
```

> :warning: **Make sure that these ports are available and docker is installed on your local machine:
> * :5001
> * :5002
> * :5003
> * :5004
> * :5005   

**Step 2: Run the test data endpoint if needed**

We have made a endpoint setting up test data for orders in mongoDB if needed which is located at the following URI:

*https://localhost:5001/Gateway/test-data*
